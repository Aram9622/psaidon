<h1>IMathAS</h1>
<p>Version: 1.2.  See <a href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> for detailed change history.</p>

<h3>What is IMathAS</h3>
<p>IMathAS is an Internet Mathematics Assessment System.  In essence, it is a very light
Course Management System (CMS), most similar to (and inspired by) <a href="http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/">WebWork</a> 
and <a href="http://wims.unice.fr/">WIMS</a>, and similar to publisher-produced systems 
like iLrn, MathXL, etc.</p>

<p>IMathAS was written by <a href="http://www.pierce.ctc.edu/dlippman">David Lippman</a> (c) 2006, and is distributed under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.  See the license.txt file distributed with IMathAS for more details
and credits for components attributed to others.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>IMathAS was built on three primary philosophies:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Math</b>:  The system was designed for Math assessment; no effort was made for the system to be multi-purpose.</li>
<li><b>Sharing</b>:  The system was setup to encourage sharing of questions within a system and outside.  Questions are grouped into
    question libraries, and are not tied directly to a specific assessment.  Unless marked Private, questions can be used by
    anyone on the system, or used as a template for writing new questions.  Assessments and course setups can be copied
    between users with permission.  Export and Import allows the 
    sharing of question sets between systems.  Also, macro libraries allow for the expansion of IMathAS's question language.  
    Users with expertise in a field can develop macro extensions, and share them with other users.</li>
<li><b>Ease of Install</b>:  The system uses standard PHP and MySQL.  It requires no special compilation options or installation
    of external programs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Core Features include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Display:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Rich Math and Graph display, using standards-based MathML and SVG, powered
	    by Peter Jipsen's <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/svg/asciisvg.html">ASCIIsvg</a> and
	    <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html">ASCIIMathML</a>, or using image fallbacks</li>
	<li>Rich Text Editor with built-in Math and Graph support for text items displayed in a course and forum posts</li>
	<li>Alternate display options for screenreaders and browsers without needed support</li>
	</ul>
<li>Assessment:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Question types including:</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Functions, with answers like "sin(x)"</li>
		<li>Numbers, compared to a given tolerance</li>
		<li>Calculated Numbers, like 5/3 or 2^5</li>
		<li>Multiple-Choice</li>
		<li>Multiple-Answer</li>
		<li>Matching</li>
		<li>String</li>
		<li>Essay (not computer graded)</li>
		<li>Numerical Matrix</li>
		<li>Calculated Matrix</li>
		<li>Multipart</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Multiple display options and assessment settings, including an option for practice sets, and
	    due date exceptions for individual students</li>
	<li>Algorithmically generated questions, with a relatively simple-to-use question language 
	    (loosely based on PHP) with many built-in randomizers and display macros</li>
	<li>Group assessments</li>
	<li>Expandable question language, by installing additional macros</li>
	</ul>
<li>Other Course Features</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Post text items, uploaded files, or web links to the classroom</li>
	<li>Basic Discussion Forums</li>
	</ul>
<li>Administration:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Flexible administration:  IMathAS can be centrally administered, 
	    or teachers can be given rights to create their own courses</li>
	<li>Teachers can be grouped by school or other division, with one or more group administrators</li>
	<li>Courses can have one or more teachers</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Details</h4>
For details on how the system works, look over the <a href="help.html">Help File</a>

<h3>Why a new system</h3>
<p>You may be wondering why another system, when excellent systems already exist, or 
why this wasn't designed as a BlackBoard Building Block or Moodle Module.  The answers
are actually pretty simple, and based on pure practicality.</p>

<p>For my purposes, WebWork and WIMS were too difficult to install (since I don't have direct 
access to my school's webserver).</p>

<p>I didn't write it as a Moodle Module because my school doesn't have Moodle installed.  I
didn't write it as a BlackBoard Building Block because my school doesn't have the Enterprise
version of BlackBoard.  Certainly IMathAS could be integrated with Moodle or BlackBoard, and
I encourage anyone with a development server and the know-how to take it on.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
Beginning with version 1.2, IMathAS is distributed in the configuration used on WAMAP.org, 
including information pages.  The loginpage, info pages, and diagnostic front-end will need to 
be editted to work with your install if you want to use them.
<ol>
<li>Download IMathAS, unzip it, and copy the directory to your webserver</li>
<li>Change permissions (chmod) of the following directories to allow the webserver process
    to write to the directories:</li>
    	<ul>
	<li>assessment/libs</li>
	<li>assessment/qimages</li>
	<li>admin/import</li>
	<li>course/files</li>
	<li>filter/graph/imgs</li>
	</ul>
<li>Copy the config.php.dist to config.php and edit it.  Change these options to your liking:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>$dbserver:  The address of your database server.  Probably www.yoursite.edu or localhost</li>
	<li>$dbname:  The name of the IMathAS database</li>
	<li>$dbusername:  The username of the IMathAS database user.</li>
	<li>$dbpassword:  The password for the IMathAS database user.  Choose something really complicated</li>
	<li>$installname: The name of your installation, for personalization.</li>
	<li>$longloginprompt:  How you want to prompt new students for a username</li>
	<li>$loginprompt:  How you want to prompt students for a username</li>
	<li>$loginformat:  Enforce a format requirement on the username</li>
	<li>$emailconfirmation:  If set to true, new users will have to respond to an email sent by the system 
	    before being able to enroll in any classes</li>
	<li>$sendfrom:  An email address to send confirmation emails from.</li>
	<li>$imasroot:  The web root of the imathas install (ie, http://yoursite.edu $imasroot)</li>
	<li>$mathimgurl: An absolute path or full url to a Mimetex CGI installation, for math image fallback</li>
	<li>$freetypeinstalled: Whether the FreeType extension is installed and GD 2.0+ is used in your php version.</li>
	<li>$colorshift:  Whether icons should change colors as due date approaches.  I thought this was cute, 
	    but others might find it annoying</li>
	<li>$allownongrouplibs:  Whether non-admins should be allowed to create non-group libraries.  
		On a single-school install, set to true; for larger installs that plan to
		use the Groups features, set to false</li>
	<li>$allowcourseimport:  Whether anyone should be able to import/export questions and libraries from the
	    course page.  Intended for easy sharing between systems, but the course page
	    is cleaner if turned off.</li>
	<li>$allowmacroinstall:  Whether admins should be able to install macro files.  Macros files hold a large 
	    security risk, and should only be installed from trusted sources.  For a single-admin system, it is 
	    recommended that you leave this as false, and change it when you need to install a macro</li>
	<li>$sessionpath:  change the session file path different than the default.
	    This is usually not necessary unless your site is on a server farm, or 
	    you're on a shared server and want more security of session data</li>
	</ul>
<li>Run the dbsetup.php script (access http://yoursite.edu $imasroot/dbsetup.php), or send it 
    to your system administrator and ask them to run it, if you don't have creation access
    to the database server.  Alternatively, have your system administrator create a database and database user,
    and use these names in the config.php file before running dbsetup.php.  This script sets up the necessary database user, database, and tables for IMathAS.</li>
<li>Delete the dbsetup.php script, or store it somewhere not on the webserver</li>
<li>Log into IMathAS.  Access http://yourside.edu $imasroot.  If you didn't change the
    initial imathas user settings when running dbsetup.php, log in as 'root' with password 'root'. 
    If you did not change the inital imathas user settings, click the "Change Password"
    link now to change the password to something substantial.  Alternatively, you can
    go into the Admin page, create a new user with Admin rights, then delete the 'root'
    admin.</li>
<li>Edit loginpage.php to reflect your installation, edit /diag/index.php to reflect your 
installation, and delete or edit the files in /info subdirectory.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Answers to IT's questions</h3>
<h4>Versions</h4>
The system should work with version 4.2.0 or higher of PHP.  It has been tested
on PHP5 and PHP4.2.2.  PHP5 does not have MySQL support enabled by default, but
needs to be enabled for IMathAS.  The system has been tested with MySQL 3.23, but 4+ is recommended.  IMathAS
uses the mysql_ library of PHP, not the mysqli_ library.

<h4>CPU Use</h4>
<p>A standard student session consisting of completing a 10 question assessment with a few reattempts 
then checking the gradebook will use about 2 cpu seconds total.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>IMathAS uses a standard databased-stored sessions-based system.  Only the userid is stored
in the session cookie; rights are always looked up from the database.  If a user does
not log out, the session is cleared from database after 24 hours.</p>

<p>Questions (written by teachers) are passed through an interpreter that only allows 
authorized functions to be used.  Student answers are evaluated client-side using
JavaScript, and are never evaled server-side.</p>

<p>Macro Libraries (PHP function libraries that can be used in writing questions) 
can only be installed by full Admins in IMathAS.  The option allowing install can be 
disabled in the config.php file</p>

<p>All user input stored in the database is passed through add_slashes (or magic_quotes is used, if enabled)
to prevent SQL injection attacks</p>
