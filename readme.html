<h1>IMathAS</h1>
<p>Version: 1.6.   Released   2008 <br/>
See <a href="changelog.html">Change Log</a> for detailed change history.</p>

<h3>What is IMathAS</h3>
<p>IMathAS is an Internet Mathematics Assessment System. It is primarily a 
web-based math assessment tool for delivery and automatic grading of math homework 
and tests. Questions are algorithmically generated and numerical and math expression
answers can be computer graded. Beyond that, IMathAS includes learning management tools, 
including posting of announcements, text files, and attachments, as well as discussion 
forums and a full gradebook. In postings and assessments, IMathAS allows accurate display 
of math and graphs, with simple calculator-style math entry and point-and-click graph 
creation.   It is most similar to (and inspired by) <a href="http://webwork.math.rochester.edu/">WebWork</a> 
and <a href="http://wims.unice.fr/">WIMS</a>, and similar to commercial and publisher-produced systems 
like iLrn, MathXL, WebAssign, etc.</p>

<p>IMathAS was written by <a href="http://www.pierce.ctc.edu/dlippman">David Lippman</a> (c) 2006-2008, and is distributed under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.  See the license.txt file distributed with IMathAS for more details
and credits for components attributed to others.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<h4>IMathAS was built on three primary philosophies:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Math</b>:  The system was designed for Math assessment; no effort was made for the system to be multi-purpose.</li>
<li><b>Sharing</b>:  The system was setup to encourage sharing of questions within a system and outside.  Questions are grouped into
    question libraries, and are not tied directly to a specific assessment.  Unless marked Private, questions can be used by
    anyone on the system, or used as a template for writing new questions.  Assessments and course setups can be copied
    between users with permission.  Export and Import allows the 
    sharing of question sets between systems.  Also, macro libraries allow for the expansion of IMathAS's question language.  
    Users with expertise in a field can develop macro extensions, and share them with other users.</li>
<li><b>Ease of Install</b>:  The system uses standard PHP and MySQL.  It requires no special compilation options or installation
    of external programs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Core Features include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Display:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Rich Math and Graph display, using standards-based MathML and SVG, powered
	    by Peter Jipsen's <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/svg/asciisvg.html">ASCIIsvg</a> and
	    <a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html">ASCIIMathML</a>, or using image fallbacks</li>

<h3>Why a new system</h3>
<p>You may be wondering why another system, when excellent systems already exist.</p>

<p>For my purposes, WebWork and WIMS were too difficult to install (since I don't have direct 
access to my school's webserver).  I didn't want to use commercial or publisher produced systems
because I don't want students with used books to incur additional cost.</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download IMathAS, unzip it, and copy the directory to your webserver</li>
<li>Change permissions (chmod) of the following directories to allow the webserver process
    to write to the directories:</li>
    	<ul>
	<li>assessment/libs</li>
	<li>assessment/qimages</li>
	<li>admin/import</li>
	<li>course/files</li>
	<li>filter/graph/imgs</li>
	</ul>
<li>Rename (in the main directory):
	<ul>
	<li>config.php.dist to config.php</li>
	<li>infoheader.php.dist to infoheader.php</li>
	<li>loginpage.php.dist to loginpage.php</li>
	<li>newinstructor.php.dist to newinstructor.php</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Edit config.php.  Change these options to your liking:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>$dbserver:  The address of your database server.  Probably www.yoursite.edu or localhost</li>
	<li>$dbname:  The name of the IMathAS database</li>
	<li>$dbusername:  The username of the IMathAS database user.</li>
	<li>$dbpassword:  The password for the IMathAS database user.  Choose something really complicated</li>
	<li>$installname: The name of your installation, for personalization.</li>
	<li>$longloginprompt:  How you want to prompt new students for a username</li>
	<li>$loginprompt:  How you want to prompt students for a username</li>
	<li>$loginformat:  Enforce a format requirement on the username</li>
	<li>$emailconfirmation:  If set to true, new users will have to respond to an email sent by the system 
	    before being able to enroll in any classes</li>
	<li>$sendfrom:  An email address to send confirmation emails from.</li>
	<li>$imasroot:  The web root of the imathas install (ie, http://yoursite.edu $imasroot)</li>
	<li>$mathimgurl: An absolute path or full url to a Mimetex CGI installation, for math image fallback</li>
	<li>$colorshift:  Whether icons should change colors as due date approaches.  I thought this was cute, 
	    but others might find it annoying</li>
	<li>$smallheaderlogo: Text or an HTML image tag for a small (120 x 80) logo to display at the top right of
	    course pages</li>
	<li>$allownongrouplibs:  Whether non-admins should be allowed to create non-group libraries.  
		On a single-school install, set to true; for larger installs that plan to
		use the Groups features, set to false</li>
	<li>$allowcourseimport:  Whether anyone should be able to import/export questions and libraries from the
	    course page.  Intended for easy sharing between systems, but the course page
	    is cleaner if turned off.</li>
	<li>$allowmacroinstall:  Whether admins should be able to install macro files.  Macros files hold a large 
	    security risk, and should only be installed from trusted sources.  For a single-admin system, it is 
	    recommended that you leave this as false, and change it when you need to install a macro</li>
	<li>$sessionpath:  change the session file path different than the default.
	    This is usually not necessary unless your site is on a server farm, or 
	    you're on a shared server and want more security of session data</li>
	</ul>
<li>Run the dbsetup.php script (access http://yoursite.edu $imasroot/dbsetup.php), or send it 
    to your system administrator and ask them to run it, if you don't have creation access
    to the database server.  Alternatively, have your system administrator create a database and database user,
    and use these names in the config.php file before running dbsetup.php.  This script sets up the necessary database user, database, and tables for IMathAS.</li>
<li>Delete the dbsetup.php script, or store it somewhere not on the webserver</li>
<li>Log into IMathAS.  Access http://yourside.edu $imasroot.  If you didn't change the
    initial imathas user settings when running dbsetup.php, log in as 'root' with password 'root'. 
    If you did not change the inital imathas user settings, click the "Change Password"
    link now to change the password to something substantial.  Alternatively, you can
    go into the Admin page, create a new user with Admin rights, then delete the 'root'
    admin.</li>
<li>Edit loginpage.php and infoheader.php if desired.</li>
<li>If you plan to use the new instructor account request page, edit newinstructor.php</li>
</ol>

<h3>System Requirements</h3>
<h4>Versions</h4>
<p>PHP 5 and MySQL 4+ are recommended.  Most of the system will work with PHP 4.2+
and MySQL 3.23, but future compatibility is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>PHP with GD2 and Treetype are recommended for best image-based graph support</p> 

<h4>CPU Use</h4>
<p>A standard student session consisting of completing a 10 question assessment with a few reattempts 
then checking the gradebook will use about 2 cpu seconds total.  An installation serving 2500+ students 
with 80+ concurrent users has operated well on a commercial shared web server.</p>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>IMathAS uses a standard databased-stored sessions-based system.  If a user does
not log out, the session is cleared from database after 24 hours.</p>

<p>Questions (written by teachers) are passed through an interpreter that only allows 
authorized functions to be used.  Student answers are evaluated client-side using
JavaScript, and are never evaled server-side.</p>

<p>Macro Libraries (PHP function libraries that can be used in writing questions) 
can only be installed by full Admins in IMathAS.  The option allowing install can be 
disabled in the config.php file</p>
