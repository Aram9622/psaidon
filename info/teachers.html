<h2>More about WAMAP/IMathAS</h2>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p class="ind"><a href="http://www.imathas.com">IMathAS</a> is the software powering WAMAP.  IMathAS is a 
web-based math assessment tool for delivery and automatic
grading of math homework and tests.  Questions are algorithmically generated so each student gets a 
different version of each question, and numerical and math expression answers can be computer graded.</p>

<p class="ind">Beyond that, IMathAS includes basic learning
management tools, including posting of announcements, text files, and attachments, as
well as basic discussion forums.  In postings, assessments, and forums, IMathAS allows
accurate display of math and graphs, with simple calculator-style math entry and
point-and-click graph creation.
</p>


<p class="ind">To try out the system, <a href="/course/course.php?folder=0&cid=2">log in</a> with username: <b>demo</b>, password: <b>demo</b> to view a demo course from a student's 
perspective</p>


<p class="ind">To find out more, read about <a href="teachers2.html">what WAMAP can do for you</a>. 
Details about using individual features can be found in the <a href="/help.html">help file</a></p>


<h4>Content</h4>
<p class="ind">Over 2500 questions from the arithmetic through calculus levels have already been written.  
This began with 1500 questions translated, with permission, from <a href="http://webwork.math.rochester.edu">WebWork</a> 
from the Univ of Rochester, and was expanded with development grant support from the Washington State Distance Learning Council.
The question set continues to grow with user contributions, and will soon be expanded further with another development grant from
the Distance Learning Council.

</p>


<p class="ind">Since you can adapt existing questions or create new questions, you can make sure questions address the topics
you wish to assess while helping expand the shared question library</p>



<h4>Support</h4>
<p class="ind"><a href="/docs/docs.html">Use Guides and documentation</a> are available to assist you in getting familiar with IMathAS.  Limited support is 
available through email and through the Support Course discussion forums.</p>


<h2>The purpose of this website</h2>
<p class="ind">This website has been generously funded by the <a href="http://www.transitionmathproject.org">Transition Math Project</a> to
provide free use of the IMathAS system by High School and College instructors throughout the state of Washington.  Of course, if
you'd prefer, you can also <a href="http://imathas.sourceforge.net">download</a> and install the software on your local webserver.</p>
