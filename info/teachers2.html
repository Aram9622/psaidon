<h2>What WAMAP Can Do</h2>

<p>WAMAP is designed to be extremely flexible, and can be used for a variety of
purposes.  Here's a few.

<h4>Drill & Practice</h4>
<p>Create sets of drill and practice problems to reinforce mastery of math skills.  
Because questions are algorithmically generated, students can practice virtually
unlimited versions of the questions.  Students receive immediate feedback, allowing
them to correct mistakes immediately.</p>

<p>Alternatively, print out pages of drill problems to hand out in class.</p>

<h4>Homework</h4>
<p>Assign graded homework while freeing your time.  With WAMAP's flexible assignment
options, you can allow students multiple attempts per problem, or even allow student
to keep trying similar problems until they earn full credit.  Since each student
receives a different version of each question, even if you go over a homework question
in class, students still have to work through their version of the question to earn credit.
Students can work together on homework without being able to just copy answers.  And you 
can easily make due date exceptions for individual students if needed.</p>

<h4>Take-Home Tests</h4>
<p>Give each of your students different versions of your take-home exam, so they can
work together without being able to just copy answers.  Since you can view the version
of the test each student received and change the grade the computer assigns, you have
answer keys for each version and can fairly quickly review the student's work and assign
partial credit if desired.</p>

<h4>In-Class Tests, Quizzes, Group Work</h4>
<p>If you're lucky enough to teach in a computer classroom, you can use WAMAP to deliver
tests or quizzes.  You can also create individual or group work assignments can be 
worked on during class</p>

<h4>Encourage Communication</h4>
<p>WAMAP has discussion forums and an internal message system with support for
accurate math and graph display using simple calculator-style math entry and
a point-and-click graphing tool.</p>

<p>You can easily send an email or internal message to all your students, or send
a student a message about an assignment, quoting the specific question.</p>

<h4>Track Student Progress</h4>
<p>WAMAP's integrated gradebook will let you track your students' progress.  You can 
even enter your offline grades, so students can track their overall progress in your
course.</p>

<p>For online assignments, you can view how your class performed on each individual 
question, allowing you to identify areas of weakness.</p>

<h4>Share Information With Your Students</h4>
<p>With WAMAP's course management features, you can post announcements, online
lectures, your syllabus, handouts, and other information in your course page.</p>

<h2>About the Questions</h2>
<p>Over 2500 questions are ready to use ranging from arithmetic through calculus, 
or you can create your own questions.  WAMAP questions are algorithmically generated, 
including support for algorithmically generated graphs and charts.  A variety of
answer types can be computer graded, including:
<ul>
<li>Numerical, compared to given tolerance</li>
<li>Numerical expressions, like 5/3 or sqrt(3)</li>
<li>Algebraic expressions, like 5x^2 or 3sin(x)</li>
<li>Multiple-choice</li>
<li>Multiple-answer</li>
<li>Matching</li>
<li>String, like a word or letters</li>
<li>Matrix</li>
<li>Multipart</li>
<li>Essay (not computer graded)</li>
</ul>
