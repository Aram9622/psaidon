all email links, mailto->masssend?  
Student email list (need to add student privacy settings first)
photos of students
student file - attachments and assessments

Documentation

Assessment Options
*Force completion of question before moving on: oneattime and seq mode
add reattempt whole assessment option (keep best of all full attempts)
Must get all questions right to submit
Don’t list potential questions if already added (option?) (find room for the option)
Listing questions for assessment – have option to list the libraries of the questions that have already been added. (need to find room for it)
Have practice-first option on assessments. (option for toggling to review mode)
List questions once when in multiple libraries searched (have to work out list lib link)
*points per problem - decimal/fraction, or point total for whole assessment 
   (maybe scale assessment to __ pts, but would be weird from student perspective (pt values don't mean what they say)
extra credit inside assessment (put on question itself - if set, calculate points possible without it, but give it points in i_a_s.  That part's easy;
   getting the display right in showtest will be tricky.)
Add default tolerance option to assessment settings

Editor
*handle html tags in editors better

Gradebook
add link to modify code / report error in gradebook assessment edit
pagated gradebook?
*csv export: pts value in separate row? (allow double-header on inputs)
GPA, edittable and from lookup (need separate way to store GPA, fill stored from lookup when switched)
*gradebook filter by section (where to put?)
customizable grade reports (select items to report)

Groups
 Randomly assign students to groups of N

Forums
*next/prev thread links (tricky)
finish delete forum post option (error on remove first in thread?) (need to track if child exists, etc)

Message System
threaded messages?
signature for emails/msgs (need field and page (chg user info?))

*Library/Question System
attach notes/comments to libraries, questions
Instructor specific library/question listing
Rework question import/export to handle questions with images
Assign libraries in preview
New behavior to assign to libraries (popup?)
Select from Assessment in question management (for assignment to libraries)
Copy/Template libraries with structure assessment questions into new location (just messy to implement)
*Check question description is unique in library

Question Language
adapt "equation" to work with inequalities (check if left-right is pos/neg, check that lt/lte matches)
fix interpret: no mathphp inside quotes
check equation answerformat - fail on extraneous vars? (???)
if number answer is rounded, check if rounded correctly
add "false" to NaN check;  surpress output of divide by zero on testpoints
new question testing -- add debugs

Student User Interface
allow students to control totals at top/bottom

Instructor Interface
Links to modify course settings on home page
Course default Color control (do-able - need to integrate with block color defaults)

Admin
fix old user delete to remove more than just userid (NEED to do - simple but messy)
Admin feature: identify duplicate questions (equivalent code blocks)
restores students/course

Possibilities
Javascript answer entry editor
User customization of colors, fonts
JavaScript question writing guider
way in future: AJAX searches / libtree / page reordering to reduce amount reloaded
JavaScript improvement: lib import/export checking system
Replace SVG use with Canvas?
Student generated review
New questions review process
Support IMS Common Course Cartridge, QTI, IMS Enterprise XML (student info system integration)
Definable rights, grant rights on single question library
Parent/tutor rights for single student?
Inline question (towards interactive ebooks).  How to handle gradebook for these things?
Expand guided / conditional items.  How to handle gradebook?
Rework backtrack method to track itself
Move unenroll/delete course to backup table for __ days
Student portal/home page 
Course Calendar 
Image upload in editor (hard to track files so deleted when removed from item)
Uniform user experience (major re-visioning of user interface needed)
Tooltips for help (how to do?  David M going to help)
file attachements in posts (probably not needed)
Track views / post dates / etc.

Wait??
time graph of student grades
new item flag (hmmm)
Ignore case on equation variables (need $variable for it - has to be passed to clientside) 
Test without saving:  Test, Save, Save As.. (need temp table.. )
collapse gradebook by blocks (no easy way to do this)
Gradebook stats for students (no easy way to do this given current framework)
Default library for course? (add to courses table, pull if library not specified.  Tricker to add to course settings page)
Multipart question; submit one part at a time (needs some majorish changes, will only make sense for one-by-one or skip-around)
Use serialize for lastanswers and bestlastanswers
{   q1 -> {
	attempt 1 -> {    (use array even if one part q?)
		part 1
		}
	attempt 2 -> {
		part 1
		}
	}
}
