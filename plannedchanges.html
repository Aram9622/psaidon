Planned Changes

Misc
Incoporate mozilla font warning somewhere (set perm cookie for prefs?)
Zip files a/o files and specs on course item export
*Rework mass change dates to handle always/never dates
extensions penalty (needs db entry, lookup in gb) - either on non-completed questions, or on whole (in GB)
all email links, mailto->masssend?  
Student email list (need to add student privacy settings first)
photos of students

*Documentation
Add mass change dates/assessments to help file
Add Student Groups page to help file
Add arraystodoteqns to help file

Assessment Options
*Force completion of question before moving on: oneattime and seq mode
add reattempt whole assessment option (keep best of all full attempts)
Must get all questions right to submit
*Ability to pull n questions from question grouping.
*grid version of add question for multiple questions      
Don’t list potential questions if already added (option?) (find room for the option)
Listing questions for assessment – have option to list the libraries of the questions that have already been added. (need to find room for it)
Have practice-first option on assessments. (option for toggling to review mode)
List questions once when in multiple libraries searched (have to work out list lib link)
*points per problem - decimal/fraction, or point total for whole assessment 
   (maybe scale assessment to __ pts, but would be weird from student perspective (pt values don't mean what they say)
extra credit inside assessment (put on question itself - if set, calculate points possible without it, but give it points in i_a_s.  That part's easy;
   getting the display right in showtest will be tricky.)
*specify settings (# of copies) on Add Selected button
Add default tolerance option to assessment settings

Editor
*handle html tags in editors better

Gradebook
add link to modify code / report error in gradebook assessment edit
pagated gradebook?
csv export: pts value in separate row?
GPA, edittable and from lookup (need separate way to store GPA, fill stored from lookup when switched)
gradebook filter by section (where to put?)
customizable grade reports (select items to report)

Groups
*button that clears all groups
Randomly assign students to groups of N

Forums
*next/prev thread links
*poster name on forum subscription email

*new forum posts:  link to regular listing, mark all as read

Message System
*messages links at top
threaded messages?

Instructor specific library/question listing
Rework question import/export to handle questions with images
Assign libraries in preview
New behavior to assign to libraries (popup?)
Select from Assessment in question management (for assignment to libraries)
Copy/Template libraries with structure assessment questions into new location (just messy to implement)
*Mark/color private questions

*Check question description is unique in library
**Make assessment version of library questions modifyable.

Question Language
*calconarray with 2 arrays
*Points (x,y) type answer
adapt "equation" to work with inequalities (check if left-right is pos/neg, check that lt/lte matches)
fix interpret: no mathphp inside quotes
check equation answerformat - fail on extraneous vars? (???)
if number answer is rounded, check if rounded correctly
add "false" to NaN check;  surpress output of divide by zero on testpoints
new question testing -- add debugs
*question input box size

Student User Interface
allow students to control totals at top/bottom

New questions review process
Support IMS Common Course Cartridge, QTI, IMS Enterprise XML (student info system integration)
Definable rights, grant rights on single question library

Expand guided / conditional items.  How to handle gradebook?
Rework backtrack method to track itself
Move unenroll/delete course to backup table for __ days
Student portal/home page 
Course Calendar 
Image upload in editor (hard to track files so deleted when removed from item)
Uniform user experience (major re-visioning of user interface needed)

Track views / post dates / etc.

Wait??
new item flag (hmmm)

Test without saving:  Test, Save, Save As.. (need temp table.. )
collapse gradebook by blocks (no easy way to do this)
Gradebook stats for students (no easy way to do this given current framework)
Default library for course? (add to courses table, pull if library not specified.  Tricker to add to course settings page)
Multipart question; submit one part at a time (needs some majorish changes, will only make sense for one-by-one or skip-around)
Use serialize for lastanswers and bestlastanswers
{   q1 -> {
	attempt 1 -> {    (use array even if one part q?)
		part 1
		}
	attempt 2 -> {
		part 1
		}
	}
}
