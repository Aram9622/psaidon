</h3>Planned for Soon Future Versions</h3>

<ul>
Important
<li>Add mass change dates/assessments to help file</li>
<li>Add Student Groups page to help file</li>
<li>Force completion of question before moving on: oneattime and seq mode</li>
<li>attach notes/comments to libraries, questions</li>
<li>Instructor specific library/question listing</li>
<li>Rework question import/export to handle questions with images</li>
<li>Zip files a/o files and specs on course item export</li> 

Ability to pull n questions from question grouping.
Rework mass change dates to handle always/never dates
extensions penalty (needs db entry, lookup in gb)
add link to modify code / report error in gradebook assessment edit
adapt "equation" to work with inequalities (check if left-right is pos/neg, check that lt/lte matches)
all email links, mailto->masssend?
link to grades for assessments on course page

button that clears all groups
Randomly assign students to groups of N

<li><b>Gradebook</b></li>
<li>GPA, edittable and from lookup (need separate way to store GPA, fill stored from lookup when switched)</li>

<li><b>Options</b></li>
<li>Course default Color control (do-able - need to integrate with block color defaults)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b></li>
<li>finish delete forum post option (error on remove first in thread?) (need to track if child exists, etc)</li>
<li>fix old user delete to remove more than just userid (NEED to do - simple but messy)</li>
<li>Rework displayq to pull out multipart options before passing to evaluators (easy, but will take a while)</li>

<li><b>New Features</b></li>
<li>Student email list (need to add student privacy settings first)</li>
<li>Copy/Template libraries with structure assessment questions into new location (just messy to implement)</li>

Don’t list potential questions if already added (option?) (find room for the option)
Listing questions for assessment – have option to list the libraries of the questions that have already been added. (need to find room for it)
Have practice-first option on assessments. (option for toggling to review mode)

List questions once when in multiple libraries searched (have to work out list lib link)
signature for emails/msgs (need field and page (chg user info?))
points per problem - decimal/fraction, or point total for whole assessment 
   (maybe scale assessment to __ pts, but would be weird from student perspective (pt values don't mean what they say)
gradebook filter by section (where to put?)
extra credit inside assessment (put on question itself - if set, calculate points possible without it, but give it points in i_a_s.  That part's easy;
   getting the display right in showtest will be tricky.)
photos of students
link to student info chg on gradebook page?
specify settings (# of copies) on Add Selected button
One at a time, requiring correct answer before moving on
Don't show hints if question answer is correct (on later views)

Admin feature: identify duplicate questions (equivalent code blocks)


Maybe not / Wait
new item flag (hmmm)
<li>Ignore case on equation variables (need $variable for it - has to be passed to clientside) </li>
Test without saving:  Test, Save, Save As.. (need temp table.. )
<li>collapse gradebook by blocks (no easy way to do this)</li>
<li>Gradebook stats for students (no easy way to do this given current framework)</li>
<li>file attachements in posts (probably not needed)</li>
<li>calendar (lots and lots of work - David M on it)</li>
<li>Image upload in editor (hard to track files so deleted when removed from item)</li>
Default library for course? (add to courses table, pull if library not specified.  Tricker to add to course settings page)
Uniform user experience (major re-visioning of user interface needed)
Tooltips for help (how to do?  David M going to help)
<li>New items flag for blocks? (can't do without tracking views)</li>
<li>Multipart question; submit one part at a time (needs some majorish changes, will only make sense for one-by-one or skip-around)</li>
<li>Use serialize for lastanswers and bestlastanswers</li> 
{   q1 -> {
	attempt 1 -> {    (use array even if one part q?)
		part 1
		}
	attempt 2 -> {
		part 1
		}
	}
}

Changes made for student groups: (for reference)
Create group if none exists
Add groups
Update group scores during assessment
Link to add new group members
Clear all attempts (clear groups too, or at least clear from group)
Unenroll (no changes needed since no tables used)
Delete assessment (no chg needed)
Check that grp assess_sess exist when starting test (not needed - not in group w/o i_a_s)
Update gradebook score reflect on group
Clear scores/attempt one person (gradebook), [no need 4 all ppl clear attempt on one problem (addquestions)]
handle submission conflicts
on break from group, change asid if group creator
If turn off groups, dissolve all groups
Create group management page

BIG PICTURE CHANGES
New questions review process
Support IMS Common Course Cartridge, QTI, IMS Enterprise XML (student info system integration)
Definable rights, grant rights on single question library
Parent/tutor rights for single student?
Inline question (towards interactive ebooks).  How to handle gradebook for these things?
Expand guided / conditional items.  How to handle gradebook?
Rework backtrack method to track itself
