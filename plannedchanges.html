</h3>Planned for Next Version</h3>
<ul>
Important
<li>Use serialize for lastanswers and bestlastanswers</li>
<li>Lockdown course on assessment option (easy if lockdown on course, harder if pulling lockdown from assessments (needed for accomodating exceptions))</li>
<li>Written assignments / way to grade essay questions (fairly easy but need some time)</li>
<li>Per-part show answers after last policy</li>
<li>Student groups:</li>
1) Fix current on-the-fly groups to allow group definition at the beginning, w/ add later ability.  
   Any changes reflect on all group members.
   Changes in gradebook reflect on all members unless specified.
2) Add student_groups table for predefined groups
   Add ability on assessments to use predefined groups
   Create group management pages: manage by groups; manage by users
   User: Add to group, list of groups (on the fly and predefined) w/remove from link
   Group: Add students, list of students w/ remove from links
     

<li>Icons on skip around, sequential - needs new question status function for efficient processing</li>
<li>Instructor specific library/question listing</li>
<li>custom $previewloc</li>
<li>Add thread to top of page</li>

<li><b>Gradebook</b></li>
<li>GPA, edittable and from lookup (need separate way to store GPA, fill stored from lookup when switched)</li>

<li><b>Options</b></li>
<li>Forum links to internal messaging when allowed (for students)</li>
<li>Course default Color control (do-able - need to integrate with block color defaults)</li>
<li>Add dates/time (instructions?) to mass chg assessment (should be easy - don't need if change dates is done right)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b></li>
<li>finish delete forum post option (error on remove first in thread?) (need to track if child exists, etc)</li>
<li>fix old user delete to remove more than just userid (NEED to do - simple but messy)</li>
<li>Rework displayq to pull out multipart options before passing to evaluators (easy, but will take a while)</li>

<li><b>New Features</b></li>
<li>Student email list (need to add student privacy settings first)</li>
<li>Copy/Template libraries with structure assessment questions into new location (just messy to implement)</li>

Don’t list potential questions if already added (option?) (find room for the option)
Listing questions for assessment – have option to list the libraries of the questions that have already been added. (need to find room for it)
Have practice-first option on assessments. (option for toggling to review mode)
Move action by preview on manageqset (easy)

List questions once when in multiple libraries searched
Total & % column in GB on left?
new item flag



Maybe not / Wait
<li>Ignore case on equation variables (need $variable for it - has to be passed to clientside) </li>
Test without saving:  Test, Save, Save As.. (need temp table.. I don't like this idea)
<li>collapse gradebook by blocks (no easy way to do this)</li>
<li>Gradebook stats for students (no easy way to do this given current framework)</li>
<li>file attachements in posts (probably not needed)</li>
<li>calendar (lots and lots of work - David M on it)</li>
<li>Image upload in editor (hard to track files so deleted when removed from item)</li>
Default library for course? (add to courses table, pull if library not specified.  Tricker to add to course settings page)
Uniform user experience (major re-visioning of user interface needed)
Tooltips for help (how to do?  David M going to help)
<li>New items flag for blocks? (can't do without tracking views)</li>
<li>Multipart question; submit one part at a time (needs some majorish changes, will only make sense for one-by-one or skip-around)</li>
