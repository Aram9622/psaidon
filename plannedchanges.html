</h3>Planned for Soon Future Versions</h3>

<ul>
Important
    
<li>Written assignments / way to grade essay questions (fairly easy but need some time)</li>
<li>Per-part show answers after last policy</li>
<li>attach notes/comments to libraries, questions</li>
<li>Instructor specific library/question listing</li>
<li>Rework question import/export to handle questions with images</li>
<li>Zip files a/o files and specs on course item export</li> 

<li>custom $previewloc</li>
<li>Require one assessment to be completed before showing another (use existing minscore as trigger?)</li>

<li><b>Gradebook</b></li>
<li>GPA, edittable and from lookup (need separate way to store GPA, fill stored from lookup when switched)</li>

<li><b>Options</b></li>
<li>Course default Color control (do-able - need to integrate with block color defaults)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b></li>
<li>finish delete forum post option (error on remove first in thread?) (need to track if child exists, etc)</li>
<li>fix old user delete to remove more than just userid (NEED to do - simple but messy)</li>
<li>Rework displayq to pull out multipart options before passing to evaluators (easy, but will take a while)</li>

<li><b>New Features</b></li>
<li>Student email list (need to add student privacy settings first)</li>
<li>Copy/Template libraries with structure assessment questions into new location (just messy to implement)</li>

Don’t list potential questions if already added (option?) (find room for the option)
Listing questions for assessment – have option to list the libraries of the questions that have already been added. (need to find room for it)
Have practice-first option on assessments. (option for toggling to review mode)

List questions once when in multiple libraries searched (have to work out list lib link)
Total & % column in GB on left? (need to figure how to splice right)
new item flag (hmmm)
signature for emails/msgs (need field and page (chg user info?))
timelimit less than 1 minute (convert timelimit to seconds.  Doable, fairly easy)
points per problem - decimal/fraction, or point total for whole assessment 
   (maybe scale assessment to __ pts, but would be weird from student perspective (pt values don't mean what they say)
gradebook filter by section (where to put?)




Maybe not / Wait
<li>Ignore case on equation variables (need $variable for it - has to be passed to clientside) </li>
Test without saving:  Test, Save, Save As.. (need temp table.. )
<li>collapse gradebook by blocks (no easy way to do this)</li>
<li>Gradebook stats for students (no easy way to do this given current framework)</li>
<li>file attachements in posts (probably not needed)</li>
<li>calendar (lots and lots of work - David M on it)</li>
<li>Image upload in editor (hard to track files so deleted when removed from item)</li>
Default library for course? (add to courses table, pull if library not specified.  Tricker to add to course settings page)
Uniform user experience (major re-visioning of user interface needed)
Tooltips for help (how to do?  David M going to help)
<li>New items flag for blocks? (can't do without tracking views)</li>
<li>Multipart question; submit one part at a time (needs some majorish changes, will only make sense for one-by-one or skip-around)</li>
<li>Use serialize for lastanswers and bestlastanswers</li> 
{   q1 -> {
	attempt 1 -> {    (use array even if one part q?)
		part 1
		}
	attempt 2 -> {
		part 1
		}
	}
}

Changes made for student groups: (for reference)
Create group if none exists
Add groups
Update group scores during assessment
Link to add new group members
Clear all attempts (clear groups too, or at least clear from group)
Unenroll (no changes needed since no tables used)
Delete assessment (no chg needed)
Check that grp assess_sess exist when starting test (not needed - not in group w/o i_a_s)
Update gradebook score reflect on group
Clear scores/attempt one person (gradebook), [no need 4 all ppl clear attempt on one problem (addquestions)]
handle submission conflicts
on break from group, change asid if group creator
If turn off groups, dissolve all groups
Create group management page
