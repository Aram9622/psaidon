LTI framework plan:

BLTIlaunchrequest.php listens for launch requests (POST form)
Checks signature on request using OAuth
Required params:
	lti_version = LTI-1p0
	lti_message_type = basic-lti-launch-request
	user_id
	tool_consumer_instance_guid  (LMS domain name)
	roles (instructor or otherwise)
Optionally sent:
	resource link id (only really needed for assessment embed for outcome reporting eventually)
	lis_person_name_full 
		or better: lis_person_name_first and _last
	lis_person_contact_emailprimary	
	oauth_consumer_key = cid_###, aid_###, or sso_****   _ 1 or 0
		if 1, user accounts on wamap are auto-created using LMS data; 
			student will never know wamap username/password
		if 0, asks student to create wamap account linked to LMS account;
			can log in SSO from LMS, or log in directly to WAMAP
	context_id = LMS course id #
	context_title = course name
	context_label = course short name (eg MATH142)
	
oauth_consumer_key triggers action:
	cid set:
		trigger course embed mode with given course id
	aid set:
		trigger assessment embed mode with given assessment id
	sso set:
		trigger system embed mode with given group admin username
		in this case, secret used for signing must be MD5 of password, not actual password!

TOCHECK:
	will repost have valid signature if additional POSTs? ()

On Launchrequest:
	x check LTI enabled
	? check for request type
	x check for necessary params
	x if repost w name,email, etc.:  unset before checking signature
	x check signature, but don't mark nonce used yet
	x if cid or aid request, check availability
	x check if already in ltiusers
	if not:
		if lti_only:
			ask for name, email
		if not lti_only:
			ask if already has account. If not, provide form for it
		on submit: 
			record account info
	if yes:
		pull their info
	
	x if cid or aid request, check course enrollment; enroll if needed
	
	if session and settings exist already and not aid w timelimit
		redirect to resource
	if no session exists, or session but no settings:
		create session
		display accessibility settings
		prompt for
