Questions written using the IMathAS language and macro libraries are 
NOT derivative works of this software, and therefore are not required 
to be be licensed under the GPL.  If you wish to distribute question 
libraries or macro libraries using a license other than public-domain, 
specify the license in the library description.  Libraries distributed 
without a license statement will be assumed to be public-domain.  

It is my interpretation of the GPL (in the spirit of free software) that 
installers should not charge end-users (students) for access to IMathAS 
beyond reasonable hosting costs.   

IMathAS makes use of several components.  Not all these components are
under the GPL license.  If you know of (good) alternatives that are
available under a GPL-compatible license, let me know.

IMathAS makes use of:
